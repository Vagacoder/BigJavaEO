/*
* E23.4
Modify the BankServer program to provide complete error checking. For example,
the program should check to make sure that there is enough money in the account
when withdrawÂ­ing. Send appropriate error reports back to the client. Enhance the
protocol to be similar to HTTP, in which each server response starts with a number
indicating the success or failure condition, followed by a string with response 
data or an error description.
