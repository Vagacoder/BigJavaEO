/*
*  E23.3 Modify the BankServer program so that it can be terminated more elegantly. 
Provide another socket on port 8889 through which an administrator can log in. 

Support the commands LOGIN password, STATUS, PASSWORD newPassword, LOGOUT, and 
SHUTDOWN. 

The STATUS command should display the total number of clients that have logged 
in since the server started.

* E23.4
Modify the BankServer program to provide complete error checking. For example,
the program should check to make sure that there is enough money in the account
when withdrawÂ­ing. Send appropriate error reports back to the client. Enhance the
protocol to be similar to HTTP, in which each server response starts with a number
indicating the success or failure condition, followed by a string with response 
data or an error description.
