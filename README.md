## Introduction
In my opinion, this book is a wonderful introductory book for beginners in computer science. SBCC uses it as textbook for CS105, but only Ch.1 to Ch.11 are taught. I finished the rest of chapters by self-study, and learned a lot from it. It teaches many interesting and useful fields, including but not limit to basic data structure and algorithm, stream handle, I/O operation, relational database, HTTP, web application. After studying this book, I gained strong confidence on writing programs. I highly recommend this book for beginner.
